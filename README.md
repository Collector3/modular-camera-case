# Modular (Raspberry Pi) Camera Cases

![Camera Cases](camera_cases.png)

Cases for the Raspberry Pi foundation's camera. v1/v2 are supported (NoIR versions are mechanically similar).

**Note**: This case requires M2.5 hardware! The bill of materials is listed
below.

## Extrusion Width == 0.48mm

This case is designed around an extrusion width of 0.48mm for strength (using a 0.4mm E3D nozzle) around small areas and parts. It makes a huge difference in my experience, so if the case isn't quite right, try adjusting the extrusion width!

## Bill of Materials

This BOM lists the amount of screws for each setup. In reality, everything is usually sold in 25+ quantity packs, so just buy M2.5 screws and M2.5 hex nuts.

Of course, if you're set on doing so, threading a bit of filament through the
holes and gluing everything together can work just as well too (if no future adjustments are desired).

#### Pi Zero Case + Long Arm

* 2x M2.5 x 16mm screw
* 2x M2.5 hex nut

#### Long Arm

* 2x M2.5 x 16mm screw
* 2x M2.5 hex nut

#### Multi-jointed Arm

* 4x M2.5 x 16mm screw
* 4x M2.5 hex nut

### Hardware source

(I don't have a good source for a metric hex key, but an appropriately sized one should be in many repair kits)

#### Trimcraft Aviation RC

* M2.5 Plain Hex Nut (25 pcs): https://www.trimcraftaviationrc.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=137
* M2.5 x 16mm Socket Cap Screw (25 pcs): https://www.trimcraftaviationrc.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=199

### Material (1.75mm PLA)

(These are the various types of PLA used in the photo above; basically a mix-and-match of whatever was loaded into the machine on the day that these were prototyped)

* Ultimachine Purple Translucent PLA

* Prusa Yellow PLA (Fillamentum)

* Proto-pasta High Performance HTPLA - Aromatic Coffee

* Atomic Filament Extreme Impact Gun Metal Gray v2
