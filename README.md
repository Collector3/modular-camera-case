# Modular (Raspberry Pi) Camera Case

A modular case for the Raspberry Pi foundation's camera. V1/V2 are supported (NoIR versions are mechanically similar, but only V2 has actually been tried).

**Note**: This case requires M2.5 hardware! The bill of materials is listed
below.

## Extrusion Width

This case is designed around an extrusion width of 0.48mm for strength (using a 0.4mm E3D nozzle) around small areas and parts. It makes a huge difference in my experience, so if the case isn't quite right, try adjusting the extrusion width!

## Bill of Materials

This BOM lists the amount of screws for each setup. In reality, everything is usually sold in 25+ quantity packs, so just buy M2.5 screws and M2.5 hex nuts.

Of course, if you're set on doing so, threading a bit of filament through the
holes and gluing everything together can work just as well too (if no future adjustments are desired).

### Hardware source

(I don't have a good source for a metric hex key, but an appropriately sized one should be in many repair kits)
